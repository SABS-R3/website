      <description>Garrett&amp;rsquo;s research interests are in methods development in computer-aided drug discovery, chiefly in high throughput docking, ligand-based virtual screening, network pharmacology, cheminformatics, bioinformatics, machine learning, and more recently protein engineering. He began as an Oxford undergraduate Chemist, completing his Part II and DPhil with W. Graham Richards; in 1991 he moved to The Scripps Research Institute, California, to work on protein-ligand docking and AutoDock, and in 2000 launched the first biomedical volunteer computing project, FightAIDS@Home, which helped spawn other biomedical projects with IBM&amp;rsquo;s World Community Grid.</description>
