You do two 12-week research projects before embarking on your doctoral research.

<!--more-->

Following on from the intensive training provided in the Foundation and Advanced modules
over the first two terms, students spend the remainder of their first year undertaking
two 12-week research projects in two different research groups within the university,
which are tailored to meet the likely requirements of their substantive D.Phil. project.
Short projects address research problems of concern to industry and are co-supervised by
one or more scientists from a partner company. Students are required to write a short
dissertation on each of these rotations, written in the style of a journal article.

On completion of the short projects students undertake their substantive DPhil research
project, with the students based within the research groups of their principal
supervisor, which may be in the University or with an Industrial Partner.

Examples for such rotation projects are:
