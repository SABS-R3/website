You receive training in research skills, communication and entrepreneurship throughout
your studies.

Studying for a DPhil requires an aptitude for original, independent and critical
thinking, as well as the ability to write reports, present data, and manage projects.
Additionally, working at the interface between the life and physical sciences and across
the boundary between industry and academia requires a particularly high degree of
flexibility, as the presentation of research can differ greatly depending on context.

The Research Skills programme, which runs throughout the 4 years at the Doctoral
Training Centre, is designed not only to equip students with the necessary skillset to
carry out their research at Oxford, but also provides an opportunity to develop personal
transferable skills.

Through a series of lectures and seminars, students will be able to improve their
competence and confidence as researchers. These qualities are not only key in research,
but equally important in many careers.

Students can access additional training in professional skills through courses organised
by the MPLS Division. To learn more please visit the [MPLS Graduate School
website](https://www.mpls.ox.ac.uk/support-services). To learn more about training in
entrepreneurial skills please visit the [MPLS Enterprise
website](https://www.mpls.ox.ac.uk/enterprise).
