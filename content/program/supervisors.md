We work with supervisors across a diverse set of disciplines and departments.

The SABS CDT works with a wide range of academics across the University and there is no
fixed group of partner departments. This gives the programme great flexibility, but also
means that what follows should be regarded as only a very general indication of the
range of affiliated academics.

| Name                | Department                     | Co-sponsors                |
