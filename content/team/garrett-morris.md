Garrett's research interests are in methods development in computer-aided drug
discovery, chiefly in high throughput docking, ligand-based virtual screening, network
pharmacology, cheminformatics, bioinformatics, machine learning, and more recently
protein engineering. He began as an Oxford undergraduate Chemist, completing his Part II
and DPhil with W. Graham Richards; in 1991 he moved to The Scripps Research Institute,
California, to work on protein-ligand docking and AutoDock, and in 2000 launched the
first biomedical volunteer computing project, FightAIDS@Home, which helped spawn other
biomedical projects with IBM's World Community Grid. He moved back the UK in 2008 to
work in the Oxford spinout, InhibOx, doing real-world drug discovery, where he
spearheaded the use of cloud computing; and then to Crysalin, another Oxford spinout, to
develop novel protein engineering techniques for protein crystallization. He is now an
Associate Professor and works closely with Prof. Deane in the Department of Statistics.
