A project which examined how antibody orientation affects binding properties.

James’ research has dealt with understanding the structural properties of antibodies to
help improve modelling and inform engineering of these therapeutically important
molecules. To aid these goals he developed a database (SAbDab – Dunbar et al 2014. NAR)
to collect, curate and present all publicly available antibody structural data. Last
year he spent time at Roche’s Penzberg site integrating SAbDab with their in-house
structure database. He has also visited UCB where SAbDab is also in use and forms the
basis for their in-house antibody structure modelling platform.

He is particularly interested in how the orientation between the antibody variable
domains, VH and VL (left), affect antigen binding properties. He has published a method
and computational tool to analyse this property (ABangle – Dunbar et al 2013. PEDS).
ABangle is used at both UCB and Roche and in the antibody structure modelling community
(Almagro et al. 2014. Proteins). He has also co-authored a study that used the tool to
study structural dynamics of TCR-pMHC complexes (Knapp et al 2014. PLoS Comp Bio).

His most recent work has been to compare variable domain orientations in antibodies to
the analogous property in T-Cell receptors. In his recently published paper (Dunbar et
al. 2014. PloS Comp Bio) he shows how variable domain orientation should be an important
consideration when rationally designing therapeutic antibodies that are specific for
T-cell epitopes. In July he gave a talk at the 3Dsig conference in Boston, USA and also
won the best poster prize.
