Building community detection methods.

When investigating the causes for a complex disease, a standard approach is to find
genes which have differential expression patterns depending on whether or not test
samples exhibit the disease phenotype. These differentially expressed genes are regarded
to encode for proteins which are relevant to the underlying biological process. While
important individual proteins may be discovered via this approach, the biological
function or pathway which is regulated by these proteins cannot be understood without
the context in which the proteins act to perform said function. My research is targeted
toward providing this functional context by identifying biological modules in protein
interaction networks (PINs).

A biological module is a group of interacting molecules which perform a common function
and is regarded to be an important organizational scale in biology [1]. This project
builds upon results obtained by Lewis et al. [2] showing that functional communities in
yeast PINs can be identified at multiple scales. We aim to identify these functional
modules in human PINs and use them as a biological vocabulary for understanding the
function of differentially expressed genes.

Community organization at different resolution scales in the same protein interaction
network. Circle size is scaled by the number of proteins in the community and edge
thickness by the number of interactions between proteins in the two communities.

A long term aim for this project is to be able to identify activated pathways in
phenotypes which are investigated via gene expression profiles. This represents an
important step from identifying genes linked with a disease phenotype, to producing
biologically testable hypotheses of pathways that may cause a phenotype.
