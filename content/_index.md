# SABS:R<sup>3</sup>

The new EPSRC CDT in Sustainable Approaches to Biomedical Science: Responsible and
Reproducible Research (SABS:R<sup>3</sup>), will train students in cutting-edge systems
approaches to biomedical research and, uniquely within the UK, in advanced practices in
software engineering. Our renewed goal is to bring about a transformation of the
research culture in computational biomedical science.
