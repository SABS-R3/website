This Module is taught by the Department of Statistics and takes you through following
topics:

- Basic Concepts
- Markov Chains and Processes

- Generalized Linear Modelling
- Hidden Markov Models
- BIG DATA.

The first 8 days are generally organised in 4 groups of 90 minutes to 1. Overview
Lecture, 2. Exercise, 3. Practical and 4. Hands-on projects. One or two lecturers might
depart slightly from this format. Lectures and exercises covers models and algorithms,
while Practicals and Projects are more application oriented. The 9th day has student
preparing talks in the morning and the afternoon is dedicated to their presentation..
The students are assigned projects in advance to work on 90 minutes of each afternoon
typically in groups of three. The projects illustrate key principles of statistical
inference and since all projects are discussed by all, there should be some additional
cross learning from this activity. (Duration: two weeks)
