This module introduces core concepts in molecular and cell biology for graduate students
with a background in physical sciences.

The module will be streamed for students with a background in chemistry and those
without a strong background in chemistry. Over the course of the module we introduce the
building blocks of life and discuss how they interact to support processes such as
replication, metabolism, signal transduction and the immune system. The course is taught
through a combination of lectures, problem-solving exercises, discussions and
independent study. Topics covered* include: cell biology, DNA, replication,
transcription and translation, protein structure and trafficking, signal transduction,
metabolism, molecular genetics, epigenetics, neurobiology, immunology, cardiovascular
science, cancer, and methods used in molecular biology and structural biology research.
The course also incorporates a brief introduction to organic chemistry for students who
have little or no academic background in organic chemistry. (Duration: two-and-a-half
weeks)

*NB: Some advanced topics are covered for one stream only.*
